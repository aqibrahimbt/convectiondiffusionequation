### Boundary layer enriched Hybrid DiscontinuousGalerkin Methods for Convection dominated flow

This work deals with boundary layer enrichment of convection dominated flow problems using the Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin Method. It aims to introduce an appropriate and computationally efficient Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin formulation for the most important model problems of incompressible fluid flow, namely the convection-diffusion equation. The main contribution is the derivation, discussion and analysis of the Enriched Finite elementSpace using non-polynomial spaces (specifically boundary layer functions) for both the Discontinuous Galerkin Methods and the Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin Method.  We evaluate the robustness (i.e linear stability as well as reasonable linear systems) and accuracy of this method using various analytical and realistic problems and compare the results to those obtained using the standard (H)DG method. Numerical results are provided to contrast the Enriched (H)DG methods with standard (H)DG approaches
